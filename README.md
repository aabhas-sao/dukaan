# Setting up the development environment:

Follow these instructions if you need to build native code in your project. For example, if you are integrating React Native into an existing application, or if you ran "prebuild" from Expo to generate your project's native code, you'll need this section.

The instructions are a bit different depending on your development operating system, and whether you want to start developing for iOS or Android. If you want to develop for both Android and iOS, that's fine - you can pick one to start with, since the setup is a bit different.

#### Follow the official React Native Guide: [Setup your React Native Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

## Running Backend Server Guidelines:

-

### Setting up Server locally

- install yarn globally, if not installed

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

- create an env file and specify following environment variables

  - `MONGO_URI`: connection string to your Mongo DB cluster. \
     In you cluster create a database named `dukaan`

  - `PORT`: the port in which server will run on

```

```
